# Stock price prediction
Stock price prediction using LSTM model.
Python based machine learning model used to predict stock prices based on amazon stock data.
Model used is deep neural network based Long-Short-Term-Memory model.

## LSTM
Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture in deep learning.
Designed to capture and process time-series data.
Uses gates to control the flow of information, allowing them to learn and forget information over varying time intervals. 

## Requirements
- Python
- pandas
- numpy
- sklearn
- keras
- matplotlib
